# Basic-Iot-Dashboard
This project aims to create a web-based dashboard for monitoring sensor data from an ESP32 microcontroller. The dashboard will display readings from Light Dependent Resistor (LDR), ACS712 current sensor, and LM35 temperature sensor.

## Web Dashboard:
- HTML: Structure of the dashboard.
- CSS: Styling for the dashboard.
- JavaScript: Logic for fetching and displaying sensor data dynamically.
